<h2 id="what-whould-web">What would the web be like if it was up to you?</h2>
<p>The wonderful core principle of the web is that <em>the web is for everyone</em>. This principle is probably the base of its enormous success. And it makes the web to this peculiar place, where people can publish their own writings, their videos, their ideas. It is a place where people from tiny subcultures can find each other and grow into international, thriving communities. It is a place where the excluded can feel included. It is a place for experiments and play, for sharing and inclusion.</p>

<p>But this idea that the web is for everyone, is also a source of some strange and complicated paradoxes. For instance, if the web is for everyone, you could argue that it is also for huge organisations that want to own it. Or, another interesting paradox is: if everyone is allowed to make things on the web, you cannot expect every website to be usable for everyone: not everybody is an expert in building interfaces. And if it is for everyone, you can expect to get in trouble with regimes that do not like everyone to have a say. Bullies are allowed to use the web as well.</p>

<!-- There will be one or two sections with an H3 with some P elements. -->
<section id="active-participants">
<h3>We’re looking for active participants</h3>
<p>While the wonderful, playful, experimental web is still there, it doesn’t get the attention it should get. Large Silicon Valley corporations seem to dictate what the web should be like. But is their vision of the web really <em>the web you want?</em> Which leads to the question: what kind of web do you want? We are organising this event around these questions.</p>

<p>We’re looking for a diverse range of talks and workshops. They may be provocative or utopian, practical or speculative, corporate or common, artistic or boring. Topics that interest us are the material of the web, the web as a creative medium, as a medium for artistic expression, (creative) accessibility, privacy, the commons, the read-write web, the personal web, the non-silicon-valley web, but other topics are more than welcome as well, of course. Surprise us! Please send your proposal before 17 January 2026 <a href="mailto:v.van.gemert@hva.nl?subject=The%20web%20I%20want%20is%20…&body=Hi%20Vasilis,%0A%0AThe%20title%20of%20my%20proposed%20talk%20is:%0A%0A…%0A%0AAnd%20this%20is%20a%20short%20description%20of%20the%20topic:%0A%0A…%0A%0AIt%20is%20a%20workshop/lecture,%20and%20it%20takes%2045/90%20minutes%0A%0AKind%20regards,%0A…">via email to Vasilis van Gemert</a>.</p>

<h4 id="custom-themes">Custom themes!</h4>

<p>We are also looking for people who would like to show off their CSS skills, by submitting a tailor made theme for this exact website. Themes will be shown at random. Themes can be added via pull requests at our <a href="https://codeberg.org/vasilis/the-web-we-want">codeberg repository</a>. Or you can <a href="mailto:v.van.gemert@hva.nl?subject=A%20theme%20for%20The%20web%20I%20want%20…&body=Hi%20Vasilis,%0A%0AHere’s%20a%20theme%20for%20the%20website%20for%20the%20The%20Web%20We%20Want%20conference.%0A%0AKind%20regards,%0A…">send them via email to Vasilis van Gemert</a> as well, if you prefer.</p>

		<summary>Will you pay my expenses?</summary>
		<p>Unfortunately we do not have the budget to pay for the expenses of our speakers and the people who give workshops. We are interested in organisations who are willing to pay for expenses of people who need this.</p>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>At the CMD school of design in Amsterdam we are working on a new course about the idea that the web is for everyone. One of the terms some lecturers use when they talk about this course is <em>the web we want</em>. These lecturers have an idea what they mean when they use this term, but many people think of different things when they hear it. We want to know what you all think off. That’s why we’re organising this event.</p>
<p>Day one, 17 April 2026 is the day after <a href="https://smashingconf.com/amsterdam-2026">Smashing Conference in Amsterdam</a>. Day two, 10 June 2026, is the day before <a href="https://cssday.nl/">CSS Day</a>. We hope that visitors, organisers and speakers will stay an extra day to investigate what <em>the web you want</em> is, and thus make a better program for our students.</p>
