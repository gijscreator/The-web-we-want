# The web we want

The very first The Web We Want conference will be held on the 17th of April 2026 in Amsterdam. One of the things the organisers of this event want, is a creative web. So we invite everybody to use the HTML template, add some CSS to it, and send it back to us, in old fashioned CSS Zen Garden style.
The different styles will be shown at random to each new visitor.

## Rules

- Only CSS.
- HTML may not be altered (nope, no, no, not possible).
- The content will change, see the comments in the HTML
- Images may only be manipulated with CSS (and images will change).
- Font files with proper licences may be used (a proper licence must be shown). 
- No font services may be used.
- No javascript (only CSS, remember?)
- Think about peopleâ€™s preferences, please.
